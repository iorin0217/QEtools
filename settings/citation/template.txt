The first-principles calculation based on density functional theory are performed by using
the Quantum ESPRESSO program package [1],
which employs plane waves and psudopotentials
to describe the Kohn–Sham orbitals and the
crystalline potential, respectively. The planewave cutoff for a wave function is set to 35 Ry.
We employ the GGA-PBE functional [2]. The
ultrasoft pseudopotential [3] 1 and the dataset
of projector-augmented wave [4] 2 used in this
study are obtained in Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials [5]. They are originary included
in the New Soft-Accurate NLCC pseudopotential library [6] and Pslibrary 0.3.1 [7]. We set
the k-point grids of Brillouin-zone integrations
with the optimized tetrahedron method [8] for
the charge density of states of Si and Ba2RuO4
to 10×10×10 and 8×8×11, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the band structure of Si. Si has
the band gap, so the fermi surface is not appeared. (See Fig. 2) And, density of states　is shown in Fig. 3 Figure 4 shows the band
structure of Ba2RuO4. The pdos calculation of
Ba2RuO4 was very heavy, and the result was not
saved for ”No space left on device.” at my ECCS
machine. Figure 5 shows the crystal structure of
the Si 3 and Ba2RuO4
4 which was downloaded
from Crystallographic Open Database[11] , and
Materials Project[12] respectively. Both of them
were in the high pressure phase structure.
